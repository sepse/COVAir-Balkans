# COVAir-Balkans
A data science research project, supported by [**FLOSSK - Free Libre Open-Source Software Kosova**](https://flossk.org/) through [**Techcamp**](https://techcamp.america.gov/about/). This project's objective is to promote the use of Data Science tools and Machine Learning algorithms, through which we will analyze datasets regarding air pollution and COVID in the Balkans and get a better understanding of these phenomena. 

# Introduction
The idea about this project started years before as a citizen-science initiative to install DIY air pollution sensors in Kosovo [Sensor Community](https://sensor.community), as a means of quantifying and understanding the phenomenon of air quality and the potential causes and patterns. The advantage of this global community-driven initiative is that the data gathered is standardized, as they all use the same type of sensor, and they can be placed in areas where local communities may have concerns, thereby raising awareness about the state of the environment.

# Objective
By having access to this vast network of sensors, in-depth raw data will be gathered from 6 major Balkan cities and be used as a example to perform data science studies to find potential relationships between phenomena in general. Furthermore, as there are numerous studies that find a relationship between air quality and respiratory diseases; by having large amounts of COVID data gathered institutionally and available makes studying this phenomenon much more viable using data science tools, that would otherwise be daunting. 

# Data
Daily air pollution data has been gathered from 2019 to 2022, to coincide with the COVID pandemic, from the following cities: 

* Prishtina 
* Skopje
* Tirana
* Belgrade
* Banja Luka
* Zagreb

COVID data has been gathered from: [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus)

# Methodology
All data processing, exploration and visualization will be conducted using Python notebooks hosted in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). The material will be shared here and be available as a tool to further explore the topics and learn about air quality, COVID, data science and machine learning.

New material will be posted as we go along.
